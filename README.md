SideProjects
============

A collection of fun side-projects that I did along the way ..

1)Company Language Stack Generator : A simple python script that scrapes github for a company and returns a summary result
  of the most prominent languages used in that company. It can give a good insight on the tech stack used by a company.
  I personally believe this is a good feature that GITHUB itself should provide - summary statistics about a github handle
  like languages used across projects, average test coverage and other such useful summary metrics.
  
  Usage Example : python company_tech_stack_generator.py https://github.com/walmartlabs
  Total github projects (with language info) for https://github.com/walmartlabs : 44
  
  =========================== MOST USED LANGUAGES ===================================
  JavaScript 68.18 % 
  Objective-C 22.73 % 
  Scala 2.27 % 
  C++ 2.27 % 
  Clojure 2.27 % 
  Ruby 2.27 %
